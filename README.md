This is a direct conversion of Trylock's visibility algorithm from C++ to Java using libgdx. You can find that project here: https://github.com/trylock/visibility

The goal of this project is mostly to provide a better option than box2d lights for lighting scenes, as well as options for things like fog of war and ai visibility algorithms.
